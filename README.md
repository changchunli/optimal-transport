# Numerical methods for (unbalanced) optimal transport
This Julia toolbox provides several tools for solving optimal transport, the unbalanced extensions and related problems.

What you can find here:
- a computation of (unbalanced) optimal transport geodesics through extensions of the Benamou-Brenier dynamic formulation.
- a demonstration of "scaling algorithms" for computing (unbalanced) optimal transport using the Kantorovich formulation
- color transfer using optimal transport ;
- Wasserstein gradient flow of the total variation functional (in 1d)
- a tumor growth model computed as a gradient flow with an unbalanced optimal transport metric.
- (in construction) (unabalanced) OT barycenters for big problems (using multiscale).

and see the associated notebooks for a simple overview.

Extensions in preparation (if time permits!):
- extension of the dynamic solver to Riemannian manifolds
- gradient flow of the total variation in 2D
